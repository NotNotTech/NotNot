# Current status: DO NOT USE!
do no not not use it yet

still building first functional prototype.     



# Overview

## ECS
The ECS api is archetype based.

- Entities are dumb cattle, and query api reflects this.   Itteration over entities/components is done by array.
- Components may be classes.
- see [notnot/engine/ecs/readme.md](notnot/engine/ecs/readme.md) for more details

 

## ExecManager

Manages execution of "nodes" on top of it.  

Scheduling means:
- How often a node should execute
- What should the node wait for before executing
- What resources a node needs read/write access to



The ECS system will sit on top of this, and other things can too.

### Multithreaded by default
The execution engine is fully multithreaded.  Your nodes can be written in a single-threaded fashion as long as you specify what resource your node has read/write access to.


## goals
- Best FTDE (First-Time-Developer-Experience)
  - Steps needed to debug a sample project and full framework source should be only:
    1. Download Repository (may include Git LFS setup)
    2. Open RpgSample.sln
    3. Hit F5
    4. ... *wait a bit* ...
    5. Do stuff: Set Breakpoint / modify code+hotReload
- SLA (service level agreement)
   - 48hr rsponse time for issues.  Triage by 72hr mark.
   - 72hr response on PR requests edits.  (follow up, merge, reject)
   - monthly roadmap and changelist updates
- engine that runs on modern desktop platforms
- multithreaded.  take advantage of a 16 core system effectively.
- code based game development
- procedural workflows come first: dynamic objects, procedural scenes
- support world coordinates 1000 x 1000 km
- multiplayer by default
- modular systems
- documentation:  
  - Class and namespace summaries at minimum.
  - end-to-end example games
  - samples via unit tests
- open source via AGPL3, with commercial licensing, revenue split among contribs


## non-goals
- easy for beginner c# developers
- mobile or consoles
- computers incompatable with the tech choises made
- 2d games
- photorealism
- visual editor
- documentation
  - long-form text
  - stand-alone examples/samples
  - tutorial




- CPU Cache coherency/false sharing. 
   - see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDIkqP4JbkE&t=247s
   - Problems arise only when all are true:
      - Independent values/variables fall on one cache line (64Bytes on x86/64)
      - Different cores concurrently access that line
      - Frequently
      - At least one is a writer

### rendering?
a loaded topic.  there is scene management/spatial partitioning to consider.  camera, animation support
some potentail solutions

- Urho3d
  - https://urho3d.io/documentation/HEAD/index.html
  - https://github.com/xamarin/urho
- Ogre Next
  - https://github.com/OGRECave/ogre-next
  - ***DOES NOT SUPPORT C#***
- example silk based voxel rendering engine: https://github.com/Redhacker1/MinecraftClone-Core/tree/main/Engine
review these tutorials if need to do basic things like camera/frustum: https://github.com/gametutorials/tutorials/tree/master/OpenGL
- super low level projects, just in case:
  - https://github.com/mellinoe/veldrid

#### occlusion culling
- software occlusion culling
  - https://github.com/GameTechDev/MaskedOcclusionCulling
  - https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/masked-software-occlusion-culling.html
  - 

#### raylib
raylib seems most complete.  meaning least work to get a working renderer out-of-the-box for a "reference" renderer.
- RayLib / Raylib CS Bindings
   - https://github.com/ChrisDill/Raylib-cs/wiki/FAQ
   - https://www.raylib.com/examples.html
- raylib based debug frames.  **EXCELENT**
  - https://github.com/JeffM2501/TestFrame
- better camera implementation  https://github.com/raylib-extras/extras-c/tree/main/cameras

### Spatial partitioning notes

    - Spatial partitioning: https://github.com/prime31/Nez/blob/master/Nez.Portable/Physics/SpatialHash.cs
  - Apos â€” Today at 8:59 AM
    - I have this one: https://github.com/Apostolique/Apos.Spatial/blob/main/Source/AABBTree.cs
    - Dcrew has this: https://github.com/DeanReynolds/Dcrew.Spatial/blob/master/src/Quadtree.cs
    - Based on this: https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/src/cute_aabb_tree.cpp
    - btw, it's based on Randy's code, but his code is based on Box2D
         The Box2D creator has a presentation about it
         But our's has improvements
         Box2D has plans for other types of improvements but they aren't coded yet
         https://box2d.org/files/ErinCatto_DynamicBVH_GDC2019.pdf
         One thing that's cool is that I ported the C code to C# and by doing so I found a bunch of bugs
         There are stuff that's undefined in C that C# doesn't allow as easily
    - This is what I do in my map editor: https://github.com/Apostolique/Apos.Editor/blob/8cf0cfdabe13629f2c42932090a2a57a68f4ba18/Game/Layer1/World.cs#L41-L48
      ```cs
      public void Draw(SpriteBatch s) {
         foreach (var e in Lilypads.Query(Camera.ViewRect).OrderBy(e => e))
               e.Draw(s);
         foreach (var e in Woods.Query(Camera.ViewRect).OrderBy(e => e))
               e.Draw(s);
         foreach (var e in Clouds.Query(Camera.ViewRect).OrderBy(e => e))
               e.Draw(s);
      }
      ```
- see also: https://github.com/Auios/Auios.QuadTree for object based
- other not really optimized math lib
  - https://github.com/gradientspace/geometry3Sharp
#### approach
- use a existing approach
- if need better, create a native alloc version https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.nativememory.alloc?view=net-6.0

# native allocator
- https://github.com/terrafx/terrafx.interop.mimalloc
  - use that for native memory allocations

# TODO:



- //TODO: add expected cost of update metrics for current frame and past frames (to SimNode/Frame)
- SimNode Register/Unregister writes to the SimManager.nodeRegistry lookup.  This doesn't handle hiearchy chains added/removed, plus still need to discover the name somehow.  
  - maybe remove this.
  - and have node searches be expensive tree traversal
- 




valid ways of Adding a simNode
- to parent, regardless of if parent is attached yet
  - need a OnHierarchyAttached() / Detached() method
    - this sets the SimManager and registers to the simManager
- to SimManager, as long as specify parent by name
  - do this by passing parent name as parameter to manager.RegisterNode()



//deal with registration with SimManager
OnRegister()
OnUnregister()
IsRegistered


//deal with hiearchy
OnAdded()
OnRemoved()

handle MemoryOwner clear on dispose!
   and change the WriteMem.Allocate() method to take the option explicitly (no default)


Frame.FromPool() should recycle old frames, make chain for inspection of old state



current in progress
- create basic round-trip for entity mesh/material visualization
- Add ChunkComponent and SharedComponent workflows so rendering can build directly off of ecs instead of creating it's own one-off solution
  - rendering loop should calculate a chunkComponent renderBounds every frame, used for hint on next frame
  - RenderMesh should be a SharedComponent, meaning chunks partition based on this
- Mem/ReadMem should have an allocationOptions enum, not take in boolean.
  - also the default should be to clear on dispose for non-unmanaged types (anything with refs)
  - 

need to figure out frame lifecycle
- sync_block: swap render state (n-1, n)
  - async: render state compute render packets (n-1)
    - render (n-1)
- ???: worlds update
  - sync_block: await physics (n-1)    
  - sync_block: entityManager add/remove
  - async: start physics (n)  
  - async: spatial query start (n);
  - async: game systems
  - async: spatial query complete (n)
    - submit scene to render state (n)


"render state swap" -> "compute render packets"

need to copy render mesh/material into 
need to include shader in RenderPacket, and include shader setup/transitions

group by shader->material->mesh
