# ðŸš§ðŸš¨ðŸš§ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ðŸš§ðŸš¨ðŸš§
[!!] The NotNot Engine is currently under heavy development and is not yet ready for use!


- If you want to read the raw, messy dev/WIP notes, [see here](./meta/notes.md).
- Source code is currently optimized for "getting it working".  Not for readability nor usability.
  - A cleanup+doc+usability pass will be made prior to "go live".  


Basic Execution+ECS infrastructure complete.  Now setting up OSS infrastructure and proving utility (integrating engine features).

# NotNot?
[!!] It's not not an engine. ðŸ™ƒ

This is the beignnings of an ECS based engine.  It is still in it's early infancy, not having any feature implemented other than a  **multithreading execution engine** and an **ecs Framework**.   

# A grand, noble experiment! 
The goal of the NotNot project is to create a modern, open-source C# engine in a sustainable fashion.  As part of that goal certain consessions must be made:

- Reduced feature set to critical path:
  - No Editor / Bells / Whistles.
  - Use off-the-shelf solutions where possible
  - Target use by skilled C# developers
  - Target Desktop runtime only (dotnet6)
- Funding/Revenue paid out to contributors
- OSS Licensed under the [AGPL](LICENSE.md), with an inexpensive [Private Commercial License](./meta/LicenseOptions.md) as an alternative.
