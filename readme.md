# ðŸš§ðŸš¨ðŸš§ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ðŸš§ðŸš¨ðŸš§
[!!] The NotNot ECS is currently **PRE-ALPHA**.  Under heavy development and is not yet ready for use!

- If you want to read the raw, messy dev/WIP notes, [see here](./meta/notes.md).
- Source code is currently optimized for "getting it working".  Not for readability nor usability.
  - A cleanup+doc+usability pass will be made prior to "go live".  
## When will this be usable? 
While the individual components of NotNot have been tested, there has not been a holistic, end-to-end validation.  
To meet this "practical" validation, the BepuPhysics engine will be used as a physics module, and once that usage is validated a general "Alpha" release of NotNot will occur.

# NotNot?
[!!] It's not not an ECS Framework. ðŸ™ƒ


This is the beginnings of an ECS Framework.  Capital "**F**" in **F**ramework.  You will need to design your code workflows around this.  It's not really suitable to being added to existing non-ECS projects.

# A grand, noble experiment! 
The goal of the NotNot project is to create a modern, open-source C# game tech in a sustainable fashion.  As part of that goal certain consessions must be made:

- Reduced feature set to critical path:
  - No Editor / Bells / Whistles.
  - Use off-the-shelf solutions where possible
  - Target use by skilled C# developers
  - Target DotNet6 runtime only
- Funding/Revenue paid out to contributors
- OSS Licensed under the [AGPL](LICENSE.md), with an inexpensive [Private Commercial License](./meta/LicenseOptions.md) as an alternative.

# Funding
NotNot is a grand experiment in open source: Is there room for another open source ECS Framework?  Can it be made sustainable?  Your financial support will help make this a reality.  Sponsor NotNot through [Jason (Novaleaf)](https://github.com/sponsors/jasonswearingen?frequency=recurring).
